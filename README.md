# 3D-Warehouse-Image-Search
A Chrome extension that allows SketchUp Subscribers to search 3D Warehouse using any image.
Ready to Jump In? Here’s What You’ll Need:

Before we dive into the nitty-gritty, let’s make sure you’re geared up for this experimental mission:

A computer with Google Chrome installed: This is a Chrome extension, so Chrome is a must!
The ability to activate Developer Mode: Don’t worry, it sounds scarier than it is. We’ll walk you through it.
The ability to download and unzip this file: 3D Warehouse Finder.zip (Right-click and “Save Link As…” to download!)

Alright, Got Your Tools? Let’s Get This Extension Installed!

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the file, you’ll see a folder named 3D Warehouse Finder. Keep that handy!

Open Chrome’s Extensions Page:

Type chrome://extensions into your Chrome address bar and hit Enter.
Alternatively, click the three-dot menu in the top right corner of Chrome, go to “More tools,” and then “Extensions.”

Activate Developer Mode (It’s not as scary as it sounds!):

On the Extensions page, look for a toggle switch in the top right corner labeled “Developer mode.”
Click it to turn it ON. You’ll know it’s on when it turns blue (or whatever your Chrome theme’s “on” color is). This unlocks the ability to load unpacked extensions.

Load the 3D Warehouse Finder Extension:

With Developer mode active, you’ll now see a new button on the left side of the page called “Load unpacked.” (scroll up and see the first image for an example) Click it!
A file browser window will pop up. Navigate to the folder you unzipped earlier: 3D Warehouse Finder.
Important: Select the folder itself, not any files inside it, and click “Select Folder” (or “Open” depending on your OS).
Hooray! You’ve Installed It!

You should now see “3D Warehouse Finder” listed among your extensions. No icon will appear in your toolbar for this one, as its magic happens behind the scenes with a right-click!
How to Use Your New Superpower!

This is the fun part! The 3D Warehouse Finder extension adds a neat trick to your Chrome browser:

Right-Click to Search:
When you browse the web and you see an image of something you’d love to find in 3D Warehouse (whether it’s a piece of furniture, a prop, or even a building element), simply right-click on that image.
In the context menu that appears, you’ll now see a new option: “Find this on 3D Warehouse.”
Click it, and voila! A new tab will open, taking you directly to 3D Warehouse with the image search results prominently displayed and available for download. It’s that simple! Two clicks and you’re there.

This is an experiment, and your input is invaluable. As you use the 3D Warehouse Finder, please share your thoughts.
Happy model hunting!
