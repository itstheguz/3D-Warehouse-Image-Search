Ready to Jump In? Here’s What You’ll Need:

A computer with Google Chrome installed: This is a Chrome extension, so Chrome is a must!
This extension is open source, so if you want to make a Firefox extension based on this, be my guest!

The 3D Warehouse Finder extension adds a neat trick to your Chrome browser:

Right-Click to Search:
When you browse the web and you see an image of something you’d love to find in 3D Warehouse (whether it’s a piece of furniture, a prop, or even a building element), simply right-click on that image.
In the context menu that appears, you’ll now see a new option: “Find this on 3D Warehouse.”
Click it, and voila! A new tab will open, taking you directly to 3D Warehouse with the image search results prominently displayed and available for download. It’s that simple! Two clicks and you’re there.

This is an experiment, and your input is invaluable. As you use the 3D Warehouse Finder, please share your thoughts.
Happy model hunting!
